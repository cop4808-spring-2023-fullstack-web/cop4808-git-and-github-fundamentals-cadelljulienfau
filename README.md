## Upgraded Calc by Cadell Julien
### Due Feb, 05, 2023

### Summary:
For this homework I took homework 1 and upgraded it. These upgrades included adding buttons using html called ln, sin, cos, and tan. Now with the buttons added, I beautified  the css to pretty it up. Since it is pretty I made those buttons functions for them using the math function and then added it to sub function for click button.

### Objective:
The Objectives for this homework was to Add a new row of buttons at the top of the calculator - Making it the first row of buttons. Have it below the number output and above the "AC, +/-, %, /" buttons.
Create a new CSS class with a different background color for these new buttons and buttons should be the same size as the others and the text should be bold on the buttons. Implement 4 new functions - one for each button and implement them. Output result must stay within the digital readout.
